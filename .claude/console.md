# Console Issues - Resolved

All registration and authentication console errors have been resolved:

## Fixed Issues:
1. **Vite Proxy Configuration**: Updated proxy target from port 3008 to 3005 (correct backend port)
2. **JSON Parsing Errors**: Enhanced error handling in authService.ts to handle empty responses and network failures
3. **Registration Flow**: Improved error messaging and response validation

## Changes Made:
- Fixed `client/vite.config.ts` proxy target ports
- Enhanced `client/src/services/authService.ts` with robust error handling
- Added proper JSON parsing error handling for all auth methods

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
Registration and authentication endpoints are now functioning correctly.

## âœ… RESOLVED: Authentication Issues Fixed (2025-09-15)

### Original Issues:
- api/auth/login:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)
- Multiple login promise rejection errors
- Invalid credentials for all login attempts

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Password verification completely disabled**: bcrypt.compare() was commented out in auth.ts
2. **Mock database users had plain text passwords**: Not properly hashed with bcrypt
3. **Authentication flow broken**: All login attempts returned 401 regardless of credentials

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Enabled bcrypt password verification**:
   - Uncommented and implemented bcrypt.compare() in login route (auth.ts:111-117)
   - Added proper password hashing in registration route (auth.ts:198-199)
   - Fixed convert-guest password hashing (auth.ts:377)

2. **Fixed mock database initialization**:
   - Updated DatabaseManager.initializeMockData() to hash passwords with bcrypt
   - Demo user: demo@skemino.com / demo123 (now properly hashed)
   - Test user: test@example.com / test123 (now properly hashed)

3. **Authentication Testing Results**:
   âœ… Valid credentials (demo@skemino.com / demo123): Returns JWT token and user data
   âœ… Invalid credentials: Returns 401 with "Invalid credentials" message
   âœ… Server starts successfully with proper mock users logged

### Current Status:
ðŸŸ¢ **FULLY RESOLVED** - Authentication system working correctly
ðŸŸ¢ Server running on port 3005
ðŸŸ¢ All login endpoints responding properly
ðŸŸ¢ Password security implemented with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)

### Test Credentials Available:
- demo@skemino.com / demo123 (Rating: 1400, Level: 3)
- test@example.com / test123 (Rating: 1200, Level: 1)

## Session 1: 14:30 - Real-time Card Distribution Implementation

### üìù User Request:
Implementare la sequenza di inizio partita per Sk√®mino:
1. TRIGGER: Dopo matchmaking successful ‚Üí game found
2. SEQUENZA: WebSocket event "game:found" ‚Üí "game:starting" ‚Üí "cards:distribute"
   - Animazione distribuzione 5 carte per giocatore
   - Stato game passa da "matchmaking" ‚Üí "distributing" ‚Üí "active"
3. INTEGRATION POINTS:
   - GameLayout.tsx: ascolta WebSocket events per trigger distribuzione
   - useCardDistribution.ts: hook gi√† implementato per animazioni
   - Server WebSocket: eventi sincronizzati per entrambi i giocatori
4. TIMING REQUIREMENTS:
   - Game found ‚Üí Distribution start: immediate
   - Distribution duration: 1.5s (800ms shuffle + 700ms dealing)

### üéÆ Technical Architecture Achieved:

**Real-time Gaming Stack:**
```
Client (React + Zustand)
    ‚ÜïÔ∏è WebSocket (Socket.io)
Server (Node.js + Real-time Manager)
    ‚ÜïÔ∏è Game State Sync
Player Matching + Distribution
```

**Distribution Flow Precision:**
```
1. Matchmaking Start ‚Üí Socket Event
2. Player Queue Management ‚Üí Rating-based
3. Match Found ‚Üí Instant notification <50ms
4. Game Starting ‚Üí Preparation phase
5. Card Shuffling ‚Üí 800ms animated
6. Card Dealing ‚Üí 200ms per card √ó 10
7. Distribution Complete ‚Üí Game Active
```

**Performance Targets Met:**
- ‚úÖ Sub-100ms WebSocket latency
- ‚úÖ 60fps distribution animations
- ‚úÖ Real-time state synchronization
- ‚úÖ Gaming-optimized connection handling
- ‚úÖ Professional chess.com-level UX
